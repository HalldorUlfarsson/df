In a phase of works where the halldorophone was put into context with more established musical instruments I thought it would be an excellent idea to get it into the famed Elektronmusikstudion in Stockholm where there is conserved a large array of Buchla synthesizer modules and a modest collection of (less widely known) Serge modules. The work I produced there "Duet for EMS and halldorophone" a motet of sorts, is a splitscreen installation, with Sol Anderson playing the halldorophone and Buchla modules on one side and Tommi Ker√§nen playing halldorophone with the Serge on the other. The halldorophone is treated like a synthesizer module in this context, as a signal generator and filter.
