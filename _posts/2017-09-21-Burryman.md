Scottish born, Iceland bred composer Charles Ross previews/premiers Burryman a composition for halldorophone and (faux) bagpipe at [Sláturtíð 2017](http://www.slatur.is/slaturtid/slaturtid-2017/). Charles became interested in the halldorophone at [Eiðar Composers´ farm 2014](http://composerfarm.blogspot.co.uk/) an event organized by him and his wife Suncana at their homestead in the East of Iceland. This work has been expected since then and we eagerly await a version with embodied Scottish bagpipes.
