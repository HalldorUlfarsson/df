![Soul sister](/public/img/2018-Square.jpg)

Two new instruments are set for completion this year, "the sisters" will be the first time I create two halldorophones at the same time. One will be powered by
[BELA](http://www.bela.io) to allow for easy digital augmentation the other will have reworked analog electronics.


These instruments are part of my PhD research at the University of Sussex and one will remain with the Department of Music at Sussex.
