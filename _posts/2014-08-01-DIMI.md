During a residency at [EMS](/2012/03/01/EMS/) I got to visit a depository for musical instruments kept in collection by The Swedish Museum of Performing Arts. There I came across the DIMI-A, a defunct early, experimental synthesizer by late Finnish inventor Erkki Kurenniemi. Enthused, I spent some time and effort trying to get it loaned to EMS so I could commission a work for it and halldorophone. Unsuccessful I eventually got to work with its sister instrument (there are only the two) housed at Helsinki University Electronic Music Studio. I commissioned Johan Svensson to write music for the two instruments and we filmed Jari and My performing the music at various locations in the Sibelius Museum in Turku and later edited the music and film together.
