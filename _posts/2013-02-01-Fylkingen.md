During a Residency at Elektronmusikstudion in Stockholm arrangements were made to get [Derek Holzer](www.macumbista.com) to play halldorophone, as an added bonus he was booked to play a set at Fylkingen. When Derek took ill and was unable to travel Halldór (nervously) stood in to honour the booking.
